### üë∂üèª New Zealand Births and Deaths Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes birth and death statistics in New Zealand to understand demographic trends, seasonal patterns, and regional variations. The analysis explores how these vital statistics have changed over time and identifies key factors influencing population dynamics.
Key Questions

What are the seasonal patterns in births and deaths across New Zealand?
How do birth and death rates vary by region?
What demographic trends can we identify over the analyzed time period?
Are there any correlations between births and deaths in different areas?

Data Source

Dataset: New Zealand births and deaths statistics
Size: [X rows, Y columns]
Time Period: [Date range]
Source: [Stats NZ or other official source]

Key Findings

Seasonal Patterns: [Brief description with numbers, e.g., "Peak birth months occur in March-May with 15% higher rates than winter months"]
Regional Variations: [Brief description with numbers, e.g., "Auckland region accounts for 35% of total births but shows different mortality patterns"]
Demographic Trends: [Brief description with numbers, e.g., "Birth rates declined by X% over the study period while life expectancy increased"]
