## Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Tools:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Specialties:** Energy analysis, data visualization

## Featured Projects

### ðŸ”‹ [Transpower Energy Analysis](./transpower-energy-analysis/)
Analysis of New Zealand's energy generation capacity and voltage relationships.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- The key finding is a clear shift toward renewable energy, with solar (including solar + battery storage) now making up the largest share of upcoming electricity generation projects; this demonstrates New Zealandâ€™s strategic move away from traditional sources like hydro and fossil fuels, in line with national decarbonisation goals


### ðŸ“Š [Births & Deaths in NZ (2005-2022](./Births & Deaths in NZ (2005-2022/).
Analysis of New Zealand's births and deaths in New Zealand and the impact on overall population as well as identifying regional patterns and needs.
The most significant trend is a decline in total births since 2005, driven by women having children later and a sharp reduction in teen pregnancies; meanwhile, life expectancy has improved for both genders, but a consistent male mortality gap remains, and rural regions face higher death rates relative to their populations, raising concerns about future population decline in those areas.
